# GoIsilon

## Overview
```GoIsilon``` represents API bindings for Go that allow you to manage Isilon
NAS platforms.  In the true nature of API bindings, it is intended that the
functions available are basically a direct implementation of what is available
through the API.  There is however, an abstraction called object which can be
used by things like `Docker`, `Mesos`, and [REX-Ray](https://github.com/emccode/rexray) to integrate Isilon.

## API Compatibility
Currently only tested with v7+.

## Examples
The package was written using test files, so these can be looked at for a more
comprehensive view of how to implement the different functions.

Intialize a new client

	c, err := NewClient() // or NewClientWithArgs(endpoint, insecure, userName,
    password,volumePath)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}


Create a Volume

    volume, err := c.CreateVolume("testing")


Export a Volume

    err := c.ExportVolume("testing")


Delete a Volume

    _, err := c.DeleteVolume(name)



For example usage you can see the [REX-Ray](https://github.com/emccode/rexray)
repo.  There, the ```goisilon``` package is used to implement a
```Volume Manager``` across multiple storage platforms. This includes managing
multipathing, mounts, and filesystems.

## Environment Variables
Name | Description
---- | -----------
`GOISILON_ENDPOINT` | the API endpoint, https://172.17.177.230:8080
`GOISILON_USERNAME` | the username
`GOISILON_GROUP` | the user's group
`GOISILON_PASSWORD` | the password
`GOISILON_INSECURE` | whether to skip SSL validation
`GOISILON_VOLUMEPATH` | base path to use for root volume directory. Defaults to `/ifs/volumes` when left blank.  **WARNING: the `username` is granted root privilege to the `volumePath`.**
