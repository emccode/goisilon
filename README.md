# GoIsilon

## Overview
GoIsilon is a Go package that provides a client for the EMC Isilon OneFS HTTP
API. The package provides both direct implementations of the API bindings as
well as abstract, helper functionality. In addition, services such as Docker,
Mesos, and [REX-Ray](http://rexray.readthedocs.io/) use the GoIsilon package
to integrate with the NAS storage platform.

## OneFS API Support Matrix
The GoIsilon package is tested with and supports OneFS 7.2+ with support for
APIv2 and APIv3 (introduced in OneFS 8.0).

## Examples
The tests provide working examples for how to use the package, but here are
a few code snippets to further illustrate the basic ideas:

### Initialize a new client
This example shows how to initialize a new client.

```go
client, err := NewClient(context.Background())
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

Please note that there is  no attempt to provide a host, credentials, or any
other options. The `NewClient()` function relies on the following environment
variables to configure the GoIsilon client:

#### Environment Variables
Name | Description
---- | -----------
`GOISILON_ENDPOINT`   | the API endpoint, ex. `https://172.17.177.230:8080`
`GOISILON_USERNAME`   | the username
`GOISILON_GROUP`      | the user's group
`GOISILON_PASSWORD`   | the password
`GOISILON_INSECURE`   | whether to skip SSL validation
`GOISILON_VOLUMEPATH` | which filesystem base path to use when looking for volume directories
`GOISILON_ACCESSPATH` | (optional) URL base path to volume directories including access point. Defaults to `GOISILON_VOLUMEPATH` if not specified.

### Initialize a new client with options
The following example demonstrates how to explicitly specify options when
creating a client:

```go
client, err := NewClientWithArgs(
	context.Background(),
	"https://172.17.177.230:8080",
	"groupName",
	"userName",
	"password",
	true,
	"",
	"/ifs/volumes")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

Another example with Access Point, for users with limited permissions:

```go
client, err := NewClientWithArgs(
	context.Background(),
	"https://172.17.177.230:8080",
	"groupName",
	"userName",
	"password",
	true,
	"/user1_access_point",
	"/ifs/data/user1_volumes")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

### Create a Volume
This snippet creates a new volume named "testing" at "/ifs/volumes/loremipsum".
The volume path is generated by concatenating the client's volume path and the
name of the volume.

```go
volume, err := c.CreateVolume(context.Background(), "loremipsum")
```

### Export a Volume
Enabling a volume for NFS access is fairly straight-forward.

```go
if err := c.ExportVolume(context.Background(), "loremipsum"); err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```


### Delete a Volume
When a volume is no longer needed, this is how it may be removed.

```go
if err := c.DeleteVolume(context.Background(), "loremipsum"); err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

### More Examples
Several, very detailed examples of the GoIsilon package in use can be found in
the package's `*_test.go` files as well as in the libStorage Isilon
[storage driver](https://github.com/thecodeteam/rexray/blob/master/libstorage/drivers/storage/isilon/storage/isilon_storage.go).
